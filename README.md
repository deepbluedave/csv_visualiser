# Project: Configurable CSV Visualisation Suite

## Introduction

This project provides a suite of tools for working with CSV data, allowing for flexible configuration and client-side operation. It consists of two main components:

1.  **Configurable CSV Dashboard Generator (Visualiser):** A powerful tool that renders various types of interactive dashboards (tables, Kanbans, graphs, etc.) from CSV data. Its appearance and behavior are entirely controlled by a `config.js` file.
2.  **Config-Driven CSV Editor:** A web-based editor designed to create and modify CSV data in a structured way. The editor's schema, input types, and validation rules are defined by an `editor_config.js` file.

These components are designed to work together. The Config-Driven CSV Editor can be used to prepare, validate, and structure data specifically for use with the Configurable CSV Dashboard Generator, ensuring data integrity and proper formatting for optimal visualisation.

## Documentation

Detailed guides for each component are available:
